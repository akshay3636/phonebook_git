Please install mysql server from the folder "prerequisites" before installing the software and run the queries in "SQL Queries Used" folder. The username for mysql server should be "root" and the password should be "akshay". If these are to be changed, corresponding changes must be made in the code. 



This is a sample project in which a PHONEBOOK application program has been developed using "Visual Basic" as the programing language and "mysql" as database server. PHONEBOOK can save and display contacts data in a windows environment. Abilities like searching contacts, editing contacts, adding new contact and adding image to contact are available in the application. An Authentication system has also been provided. The login credentials are as follows

				User name- akshay
				password- plank

Programers can download and modify the source code as required. The source code is also available on Github(https://github.com/akshay3636/phonebook_git).


Scope for further improvement.

1.New data fields can be introduced like 'job title', 'fax number', 'gender', 'birthday'.
2.An account management system can be introduced so that users can change and manage their login credentials.
3.'Remove image' button can be added on the phonebook editing form.
4.Algorithms to search in a better and more user friendly ways can be added. Like algorithms to search for records like the keyword insted of the exact keyword can be added. This will improve the usability of the program.
5.A form showing data in a 'data grid' element can be added so that multiple records are shown simultaneously.
6.More exception handling codes can be added to handle every possible way the end user can mess up the inputs. This will improve the reliability of the program.
